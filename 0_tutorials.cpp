/*
    Each type of documentation will be explained 
    by showing examples of documentation for
    a program I wrote for a lab in CMSC 1240. 
     
    In a nutshell, this program allows the user 
    to find specific values of linear functions,
    but has a lot of added functionality.

/* 
    Tutorials are step-by-step walkthroughs of your program
    to a new user.They are designed to get the user started, and for them
    to begin to familiarize themself with your program. 

    Common forms of tutorials can include an inline output terminal/code 
    editor (like in a W3 Schools page), but for the purposes of
    this presentation, I'll just be writing comments in this file
    (specifically above main()).

    <tutorial>
        This program is essentially a very limited versino
        of a graphing calculator. 

        Here is a step-by-step tutorial on running this program
        for the first time: 
            1.) after the prompt, enter "0".
            2.) after the next prompt, enter any number you want
                (even decimals!)
            3.) repeat step 2
            4.) Congratulations! You've just defined a linear
                function, and found some points along it!
    </tutorial>

    In the above example, the steps to introducing a 
    new user to using the program are clearly laid out and easy to follow,
    and they familiarize the user with inputting values to operate the program.
    
    Remember, tutorials are meant to give a user a starting place
    for using the program, not to give the user an understanding of 
    the code.
