/* 
    We covered that tutorials are the first point
    of contact that new users will have with your program.

    How-to guides, then, are guides that give steps
    on how to solve a real problem. They answer questions
    that only users familiar with the program can even ask;
    in the case of this program, such a question might be
    how the user could double-check their math homework.

    <example> 
        Usage for finding some points on functions
        ======================================

        Using the input function option, inputting any A and B
        will give five points on the line y=Ax+B.
    </example>

    The above example, while simple, gets the point across. 
    In this stage, you should not be trying to teach the user
    how to operate the program -- they already know how to do 
    that (since your tutorial was so good).

    The main takeaway is that how-to guides assume some competence
    with the program, and aid in solving specific real-world
    problems.
